This is a Python script that interacts with a system that runs data replication and extraction processes. It uses the requests library to send HTTP requests to the system's API endpoints and retrieve information about the status and details of the processes.

The script first imports the required libraries: requests, yaml, and datetime. The yaml library is used to load a configuration file called "config.yml", which contains authentication credentials and the base URL of the system's API.

The script then defines several functions that correspond to actions that can be performed on the system's processes. The functions take a process name as an argument and use the requests library to send an HTTP request to the appropriate API endpoint with the necessary data and authentication credentials. The response is then returned in JSON format.

The functions defined in the script are:

* start_extract(): sends a request to start an extraction process with the given process name.
* stop_extract(): sends a request to stop an extraction process with the given process name.
* start_replicat(): sends a request to start a replication process with the given process name.
* stop_replicat(): sends a request to stop a replication process with the given process name.
* list_extracts(): sends a request to retrieve a list of all extraction processes.
* list_replicats(): sends a request to retrieve a list of all replication processes.
* get_extract_status(): sends a request to retrieve the status of an extraction process with the given process name.
* get_extract_details(): sends a request to retrieve details about an extraction process with the given process name.
* get_replicat_status(): sends a request to retrieve the status of a replication process with the given process name.
* get_replicat_details(): sends a request to retrieve details about a replication process with the * given process name.
* view_extract_report_file(): sends a request to retrieve the report file of an extraction process with the given process name, and writes it to a local file with a filename that includes the current date.
* view_replicat_report_file(): sends a request to retrieve the report file of a replication process with the given process name, and writes it to a local file with a filename that includes the current date.

To use the script, you will need to create a "config.yml" file with your authentication credentials and the base URL of the system's API. Then, you can import the script into your Python program and call the functions as needed, passing the appropriate process names as arguments.
